# PTY-QoL (PTY's Quality of Life package)

[![Build Status](https://github.com/putianyi889/PTY-QoL.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/putianyi889/PTY-QoL.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

Want just an easy feature that Julia or some package doesn't have, while the PR gets rejected/takes forever to get merged? This is a personal collection of little things that makes coding easier while not breaking existing things.

Full of type piracies. Do file an issue if this package does break other things or becomes a part of Julia/some other package.

Rule of new version: an external PR is merged, or the number of line changes reach 100.
